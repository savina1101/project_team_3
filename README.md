The navbar uses flexbox for positioning. The logo is positioned on the left side of the navigation Bar, where as the titles of the webpages in the navigation bar are set to be positioned on the right side. The "a" command is styled so every text-decoration is removed and appears as only text. The beating feature on the logo is done using css animations. The background of the logo is set to radial-gradient which gives it the circular shape, alligned on the center of the logo and using rgb, colored appropriately. The animation intervals is set to 1.5s to give it the tempo necessary. The @keyframes gives the opportunity to style the animation. Rotation, fade and others are done using the @keyframes attribute.

The footer implements a similar css styling. Except having the ul elements go througha  multilevel styling to give the webpage the dropdown menu option when hovered over. In this case that styling is used on the social media contact icons, so when the user hovers over them it will give the option to contact each group member. The logos are implemented using the script attribute and an online icon generator.
